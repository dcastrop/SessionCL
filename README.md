* `build` is not really part of the repository. This directory contains any
  autogenerated file, as specified in `CMakeLists.txt`.

* `build.sh` configures and compiles the project into directory `build`. If the
  directory does not exist, it is created by `configure.sh`.

* `clean.sh` removes directory `build`, and all of its contents.

* `cmake` is a directory that contains `CMake` modules, as specified in
  `CMakeLists.txt`.

  * `cmake/FindLibClang.cmake` is a `CMake` module that searches the `libclang`
    library in the system.

* `CMakeLists.txt` the basic `CMake` project file.

* `configure.sh` runs `cmake` command, and generates the contents under
  directory `build`. If the directory does not exist, it is created.

* `README.md` project README file

* `src` source code for this project.

* `test` test C programs.

## Configuring, Building, Installing

This project uses the CMake build automation tools. The scripts `clean.sh`,
`configure.sh` and `build.sh` have been added for simplicify.

1. `./clean.sh` will remove the directory `build`.
2. `./configure.sh` creates directory `build` (if needed), and generates the
   build (Makefile) files using `cmake`.
3. `./build.sh` runs `./configure.sh` (if needed), and builds the project.
   The output binary file is placed in `./build/sessioncl`

## Running

Use the command `./build/sessioncl [ -h | --help ]` for more information about
the options. The basic usage is:

`Usage: ./sessioncl [options] <file>...`

## Testing

***FIXME*** not yet done.

## Internals

### src

```
.
├── log.hpp
├── sessioncl.cpp
└── sessioncl.h.in
```
Under directory ./src, there is a basic prototype that uses `libclang` to
to parse a C program, and traverses the `CLang` AST representation of the
program.

## Utils

General information, orthogonal to the project.

### Printing the AST in a human-readable way

* The `test` directory contains small C program examples.  **So far, no OpenCL
  program was added to the repository**.

* The following command prints the `test.cpp` AST in a human-readable way.
  Useful for testing purposes

```bash
$ clang -Xclang -ast-dump -fsyntax-only <test_file>.cpp
```

### AST description

* CLang full AST (i.e. clang top level declaration) is represented using
  `TranslationUnitDecl`:
